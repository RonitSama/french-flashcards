# french-flashcards
A flashcard app (similar to Quizlet) but each word is timed

Note: In my experience, the Tkinter module may not be successfully installed on macOS, so I recommend downloading and running on a Windows/Linux device.
Note: This is NOT a clone-able repository, simply download the folders (/src and /images) and run src/flashcards.py. Make sure Tkinter is installed correctly.

As I continued to learn French, I was searching for a way to practice my conjugations. I created this app so I would be able to customize the process in which the flashcards functioned (and looked!). Once the app is open, an infinitive verb is displayed as well as a subject. 6 seconds later, the correctly conjugated form of the word is displayed. The task is to figure out the conjugation before the 6 seconds. Don't worry, it's longer than you think! Clicking the (check) or (x) buttons generates a new flashcard.


Please enjoy! Happy learning!
